The most common move, <a class="move" data-pos="rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/8/2n2Q2/PPPP2PP/R1B1KBNR">5...Nxc3</a>, needs to be met with <a class="move" data-pos="rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/8/2P2Q2/P1PP2PP/R1B1KBNR">6.bxc3</a>, because if white plays <a class="move" data-pos="rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/8/2P2Q2/PPP3PP/R1B1KBNR">6.dxc4</a>, well, they lose a central pawn, and <a class="move" data-pos="rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/8/2Q5/PPPP2PP/R1B1KBNR">6.Qxc3</a> doesn't work because of either <a class="move" data-pos="rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/3p4/2Q5/PPPP2PP/R1B1KBNR">6...d4</a>, where white's queen is in the middle of the board where it will be harassed, or <a class="move" data-pos="rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/7q/2Q5/PPPP2PP/R1B1KBNR">6...Qh4+</a>, whereafter <a class="move" data-pos="rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/7q/6Q1/PPPP2PP/R1B1KBNR">7.Qg3</a> is best, because after <a class="move" data-pos="rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/7q/2Q3P1/PPPP3P/R1B1KBNR">7.g3</a>, black has a devastating <a class="move" data-pos="rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/4q3/2Q3P1/PPPP3P/R1B1KBNR">7...Qe4+</a>, forking the king and the rook on h1.

							<h1 class="desc">This is the most common response to the Paulsen, black just develops their knight.</h1>

To this, black has three good responses. Both <a class="move" data-pos="r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/4P3/2N2NP1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKB1R">4...Bc5</a> and <a class="move" data-pos="r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1b2P3/2N2NP1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKB1R">4...Bb4</a> result in <a class="move" data-pos="r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1b2P3/2N2NP1/PPPP1PBP/R1BQK2R">5.Bg2</a>. In the former variation, life goes on normally and we just get a happy four knights with a fianchetto.
